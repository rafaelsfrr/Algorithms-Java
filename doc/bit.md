### Bit Manipulation

[1](https://github.com/rafaelsfrr/Algorithms-Java/blob/master/src/local/exercises/bit/InsertionOfBits.java). Given two 32 bits numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Implement a method to insert the number M into N, with M starting at bit j and ending at bit i. 

[2](https://github.com/rafaelsfrr/Algorithms-Java/blob/master/src/local/exercises/bit/BinaryStringBuilder.java). Given a real number between 0 and 1, write a method to print the binary representation.

[3](https://github.com/rafaelsfrr/Algorithms-Java/blob/master/src/local/exercises/bit/FlipBit.java). Write an algorithm to find the longest sequence of 1s that is possible to create flipping just one bit.

[4](https://github.com/rafaelsfrr/Algorithms-Java/blob/master/src/local/exercises/bit/NextLargestSmallest.java). Given a positive integer, print the next smallest and the next largest number that have the same number of 1s.
