### Dynamic Programming

[1](https://github.com/rafaelsfrr/Algorithms-Java/blob/master/src/local/exercises/dynamic/RunningSteps.java). Write an algorithm to count how many possible ways someone can run up stairs, given that the person can hop either 1 step, 2 steps or 3 steps on a staircase with n steps.

[2](https://github.com/rafaelsfrr/Algorithms-Java/blob/master/src/local/exercises/dynamic/GridPath.java). Given a robot sitting on the upper left corner of a grid with r rows and c columns. Write an algorithm to give the path that the robot needs to make to move to the bottom right position. The robot can just move to the right or down, and certain positions could be "off limits".

[3](https://github.com/rafaelsfrr/Algorithms-Java/blob/master/src/local/exercises/dynamic/MagicIndex.java). Given an array A[0...n-1]. Write an algorithm to find a magic index, if one exists, in the given array. A magic index i is defined such that A[i] = i.
