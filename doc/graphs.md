### Linked Lists

[1](https://github.com/rafaelsfrr/Algorithms-Java/blob/master/src/local/exercises/graphs/ThereIsPath.java). Implement an algorithm to find out if there is a path between two given nodes of a DAG. 

[2](https://github.com/rafaelsfrr/Algorithms-Java/blob/master/src/local/exercises/graphs/MinTree.java). Implement an algorithm to build a binary search tree with minimal height of a given array, sorted in increasing order, with unique integer values.

[3](https://github.com/rafaelsfrr/Algorithms-Java/blob/master/src/local/exercises/graphs/NodesByLevel.java). Given a binary tree, implement an algorithm to construct a list of all the elements of the tree at each depth.

[4](https://github.com/rafaelsfrr/Algorithms-Java/blob/master/src/local/exercises/graphs/CheckBalancedTree.java). Check if a binary tree is balanced (the height of two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.)

[5](https://github.com/rafaelsfrr/Algorithms-Java/blob/master/src/local/exercises/graphs/CheckBST.java). Check if a binary tree is a binary search tree.

[6](https://github.com/rafaelsfrr/Algorithms-Java/blob/master/src/local/exercises/graphs/CommonAncestor.java). Implement an algorithm to find the first common ancestor of two nodes in a binary search tree.
